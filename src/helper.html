            In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, 
            and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges 
            to be eaten while held in the hand.
            The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town 
            of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and 
            its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular foods 
            in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias 
            (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and 
            as street food.[5] Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, 
            to be reheated in a home oven.
            In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 
            pizzerias.[6] Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[7]
            The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit 
            organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.
            [8] In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional 
            Speciality Guaranteed dish,[9][10] and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of 
            intangible cultural heritage.[11]
